Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000  (Project Euler)

if we list all the natural below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3,5,6 and 9. The sum of these multiples of 23. Find 
the sum of all the the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000. But in this project you have an option to enter the number of your choice instead 
of 1000. 

*if anyone wants to see the multiple of 3 or 5 just remove the comment from the code
